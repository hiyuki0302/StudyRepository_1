 *   (b) the registered component receives the already-narrowed activity type and
 *       does not re-narrow (the discriminating `is*Activity` check lives only in
 *       the guard).
 *
 * `T` is the type the guard narrows to. It is constrained to
 * `Pick<IActivity, 'action' | 'snapshot'>` rather than `IActivityHasId` because
 * the upstream guards (e.g. `isAttachmentRemoveActivity`) narrow exactly that
 * `Pick` shape; the component still receives a full activity via `IActivityHasId & T`,
 * which re-attaches the id/identity fields to the guard's snapshot narrowing. This
 * is the "adjust the constraint toward `Pick`" resolution called out in the design.
 *
 * The single widening cast (`Component as FC<{ activity: IActivityHasId }>`) is the
 * ONLY assertion in this module and is sound at runtime: the dispatcher renders a
 * Component only after its `canRender` guard has passed, so the activity it is given
 * always satisfies `T`. `any` is never used.
