/**
 * Shape of RequestContext keys shared between the post-message handler
 * (writer) and each Mastra tool's execute (reader).
 *
 * Updating this single file propagates a type mismatch to the handler and
 * to every tool when keys are added or renamed.
 *
 * Notes on `user`:
 * - `user` is `req.user` as exposed after the `loginRequiredStrictly`
 *   middleware (an `IUserHasId`). The tool layer MUST NOT extract only
 *   `_id` or re-resolve via `User.findById`.
 * - Downstream helpers such as `Page.findByIdAndViewer` and
 *   `SearchService.searchKeyword` accept the whole user object and read
 *   the fields they need internally.
 *
 * Notes on `modelKey`:
 * - `modelKey` is the per-request model for the chat client's selection, as the
 *   composite `${provider}/${modelId}` key. The post-message handler resolves the
 *   client value through `resolveEffectiveModelKey` (the single allow-list rounding
 *   checkpoint — an out-of-allowlist / omitted key is collapsed to the effective
 *   default) and sets the ALREADY-RESOLVED key here. `growiAgent`'s dynamic model
 *   function passes it to `resolveMastraModel`, whose own allow-list check is then
 *   an idempotent defense-in-depth re-validation rather than the first rounding
 *   pass. It stays optional only for the type's sake; the handler always sets a
 *   concrete resolved key when AI is configured.
