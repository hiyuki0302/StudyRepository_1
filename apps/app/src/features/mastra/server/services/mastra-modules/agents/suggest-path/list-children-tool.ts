 * accumulate under a candidate category — instead of inferring the shelf from
 * search-hit paths alone (instructions Step 4).
 *
 * Execution rules (mirrors limited-search-tool's budget contract):
 *
 * 1. `childListingBudget` missing from requestContext -> `context_error`
 *    (no throw).
 * 2. `used >= limit` -> `limit_exceeded` WITHOUT delegating.
 * 3. otherwise increment `used`, record the path, then delegate to the
 *    grant-aware pageListingService. Permission filtering is the listing
 *    service's responsibility (it applies the viewer condition), so denied
 *    pages never appear — matching full-text-search-tool's grant handling.
 *
 * Body is intentionally NOT returned: like full-text-search-tool, this tool
 * exposes only structural metadata (path / descendantCount / isEmpty). Body
 * retrieval remains getPageContentTool's job.
