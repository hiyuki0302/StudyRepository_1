// it reads config keys and applies defensive shape guards, but never depends on
// provider-availability / effective-model-key (the dependency direction is
// config accessor -> availability -> effective-key resolution). It may only share
// the warn-dedup registry with availability.
//
// config-manager does NOT runtime-validate values: the loader JSON-parses env vars
// and casts the result unchecked, so any getConfig result may violate its declared
// type. Every accessor therefore reads through `unknown` and treats the runtime
// shape guard as the single source of truth. A malformed value is treated as
// "unset" (fail soft) with a dedup'd warn so the misconfiguration is observable
// rather than silently disabling AI (fail-silent is deliberately excluded).

// The config keys these accessors read. All three are non-env-only-by-default
// (ai:providers / ai:providerApiKeys are env-only only while env-only mode is on),
// so their resolved value is `DB ?? env` — which makes env/DB shadowing possible.
