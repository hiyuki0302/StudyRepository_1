/**
 * What one receive request owns in the shared import directory, and for how long.
 *
 * **The import claim** (requirements 2.7, 2.1). Two imports share one directory of
 * extracted JSON files and one database, so the second one overwrites the files the first
 * is about to read and empties collections underneath it. The window is wider than the
 * import itself: the receive route unzips the archive, re-reads it and queries the
 * destination for conflicts first, and on a large transfer that takes minutes.
 *
 * The claim is therefore taken in a middleware placed before multer, and it is given back
 * by whoever ends up owning the work. Both halves are load-bearing and are tested here:
 *
 * - taken any later, the upload itself is unprotected;
 * - given back when the *response* ends, it would be free while the import is still
 *   writing — express does not stop the handler when the client disconnects, so the retry
 *   an operator reaches for after a dropped transfer would walk straight into the first
 *   import's writes;
 * - never given back at all, a rejected or abandoned upload would refuse every import for
 *   the lifetime of the process.
 *
 * So the handler takes the claim over at its start and releases it in its own `finally`,
 * and the response's `close` only releases a claim the handler never got to take.
 *
 * **Getting the refusal back to the source.** The claim is checked from the headers, so
 * the refusal is decided while the archive is still arriving. Sent then, it does not reach
 * the source at all: the connection breaks under the unread upload and the pusher gets a
 * send error in its place, which is the one thing that would leave the operator without
 * the reason. So the route reads the archive to the end and throws it away first.
 *
 * **The received archive.** Each transfer now lands under a name of its own, and nothing
 * else in this route ever removes it — the only sweep of the import directory is the admin
 * screen's "delete all". Left behind, a wiki transferred twice would cost twice its size
 * on the destination's disk, for good. So the same `finally` deletes it, on success and on
 * failure alike.
