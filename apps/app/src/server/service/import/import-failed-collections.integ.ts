/**
 * What `ImportService.import()` tells the outside world when a run ends (requirement 2.8).
 *
 * Two channels, and both used to mislead:
 *
 *  - the **return value**. The import deliberately carries on past a collection it could
 *    not read — that policy is unchanged — but it used to keep that entirely to itself,
 *    logging the failure and emitting a progress event while returning nothing. The caller
 *    could not tell a completed transfer from one that left the destination half filled,
 *    and the operator on the source side was told the transfer had finished.
 *  - the **'onTerminateForImport' event**, which the admin screen turns into a green
 *    "Import process has completed." It used to fire right after the per-collection loop:
 *    before the page normalization that can run for minutes and while the route still held
 *    the import claim, so an operator who acted on it and re-imported was refused with a
 *    409; and it fired for a partly failed run just the same.
