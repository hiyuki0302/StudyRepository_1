# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Modernize and optimize the GROWI official Docker image's Dockerfile (`apps/app/docker/Dockerfile`) and `docker-entrypoint.sh` based on 2025-2026 best practices. Target Node.js 24 and incorporate findings from the memory report (`apps/app/tmp/memory-results/REPORT.md`) to improve memory management.

### Summary of Current State Analysis

**Current Dockerfile structure:**
- 3-stage structure: `base` → `builder` → `release` (based on node:20-slim)
- Monorepo build with pnpm + turbo, production dependency extraction via `pnpm deploy`
- Privilege drop from root to node user using gosu (after directory creation in entrypoint)
- `COPY . .` copies the entire context into the builder
- Application starts after running `npm run migrate` in CMD

**GROWI-specific design intentions (items to maintain):**
- Privilege drop pattern: The entrypoint must create and set permissions for `/data/uploads` and `/tmp/page-bulk-export` with root privileges, then drop to the node user for execution
- `pnpm deploy --prod`: The official method for extracting only production dependencies from a pnpm monorepo
- Inter-stage artifact transfer via tar.gz: Cleanly transfers build artifacts to the release stage
- `apps/app/tmp` directory: Required in the production image as files are placed there during operation
- `--expose_gc` flag: Required for explicitly calling `gc()` in batch processing (ES rebuild, import, etc.)
- `npm run migrate` in CMD: Automatically runs migrations at startup for the convenience of Docker image users

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modernize Base Image and Build Environment

**Objective:** As an infrastructure administrator, I want the Dockerfile's base image and syntax to comply with the latest best practices, so that security patch application, performance improvements, and maintainability enhancements are achieved

**Summary**: DHI base images adopted (`dhi.io/node:24-debian13-dev` for build, `dhi.io/node:24-debian13` for release) with up to 95% CVE reduction. Syntax directive updated to auto-follow latest stable. pnpm activated via `corepack enable` (version pinned by the workspace `packageManager` field). Fixed `---frozen-lockfile` typo and eliminated hardcoded pnpm version.

> **Decision update (2026-06):** The first implementation installed pnpm via the `wget https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh` standalone script to avoid corepack (which is announced for removal in Node.js 25+). In practice that approach caused recurring build problems, so the Dockerfiles (`apps/app`, then `apps/growi-vault-manager`) switched to `corepack enable`. corepack's removal timeline is not certain — it may well survive — and if it is dropped we expect a more robust pnpm bootstrap than the wget script to be established by then. **Treat `corepack enable` as the current standard; do not revert to the wget script based on older wording elsewhere in this spec.**

### Requirement 2: Memory Management Optimization

**Objective:** As a GROWI operator, I want the Node.js heap size to be appropriately controlled according to container memory constraints, so that the risk of OOMKilled is reduced and memory efficiency in multi-tenant environments is improved

**Summary**: 3-tier heap size fallback implemented in docker-entrypoint.ts: (1) `GROWI_HEAP_SIZE` env var, (2) cgroup v2/v1 auto-calculation at 60%, (3) V8 default. Uses `--max-heap-size` (not `--max_old_space_size`) passed as direct spawn arguments (not `NODE_OPTIONS`). Additional flags: `--optimize-for-size` via `GROWI_OPTIMIZE_MEMORY=true`, `--lite-mode` via `GROWI_LITE_MODE=true`.

### Requirement 3: Build Efficiency and Cache Optimization

**Objective:** As a developer, I want Docker builds to be fast and efficient, so that CI/CD pipeline build times are reduced and image size is minimized

**Summary**: `turbo prune --docker` pattern adopted to eliminate `COPY . .` and maximize layer cache (dependency install cached separately from source changes). pnpm store and apt-get cache mounts maintained. `.next/cache` excluded from release stage. Artifact transfer uses `COPY --from=builder` (adapted from design's `--mount=type=bind,from=builder` due to shell-less DHI runtime).

### Requirement 4: Security Hardening

**Objective:** As a security officer, I want the Docker image to comply with security best practices, so that the attack surface is minimized and the safety of the production environment is improved

**Summary**: Non-root execution via Node.js native `process.setuid/setgid` (no gosu/setpriv). Release stage contains no unnecessary packages — no shell, no apt, no build tools. Enhanced `.dockerignore` excludes `.git`, secrets, test files, IDE configs. `--no-install-recommends` used for apt-get in build stage.

### Requirement 5: Operability and Observability Improvement

**Objective:** As an operations engineer, I want the Docker image to have appropriate metadata configured, so that management by container orchestrators is facilitated

**Summary**: OCI standard LABEL annotations added (`org.opencontainers.image.source`, `.title`, `.description`, `.vendor`). `EXPOSE 3000` and `VOLUME /data` maintained.

### Requirement 6: Entrypoint and CMD Refactoring

**Objective:** As a developer, I want the entrypoint script and CMD to have a clear and maintainable structure, so that dynamic assembly of memory flags and future extensions are facilitated

**Summary**: Entrypoint rewritten in TypeScript (`docker-entrypoint.ts`) executed via Node.js 24 native type stripping. Handles: directory setup (`/data/uploads`, `/tmp/page-bulk-export`), heap size calculation (3-tier fallback), privilege drop (`process.setgid` + `process.setuid`), migration execution (`execFileSync`), app process spawn with signal forwarding. Always includes `--expose_gc`. Logs applied flags to stdout.

**Prisma query engine resolution is intentionally NOT an entrypoint responsibility.** The Turbopack-bundled Next.js SSR client cannot resolve the native query engine through `@prisma/client`'s internal search at runtime, so the engine is pinned at **build time** via the public `PRISMA_QUERY_ENGINE_LIBRARY` env var (set per-arch in the release stage — see design.md "Prisma Query Engine Resolution"). The entrypoint does not copy, discover, or otherwise touch the engine.

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**Objective:** As an existing Docker image user, I want existing operations to not break when migrating to the new Dockerfile, so that the risk during upgrades is minimized

**Summary**: Full backward compatibility maintained. Environment variables (`MONGO_URI`, `FILE_UPLOAD`, etc.), `VOLUME /data`, port 3000, and docker-compose usage patterns all work as before. Without memory management env vars, behavior is equivalent to V8 defaults.

### Requirement 8: Production Replacement and CI/CD Support

**Objective:** As an infrastructure administrator, I want the artifacts in the docker-new directory to officially replace the existing docker directory and the CI/CD pipeline to operate with the new Dockerfile, so that DHI-based images are used in production builds

**Summary**: All files moved from `apps/app/docker-new/` to `apps/app/docker/`, old files deleted. Dockerfile self-referencing path updated. `docker login dhi.io` added to buildspec.yml pre_build phase, reusing existing `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` secret. `codebuild/` directory and `README.md` maintained.

### Requirement 9: Native Allocator Optimization (Opt-in jemalloc)

**Objective:** As a GROWI operator running under sustained load, I want an option to swap the native memory allocator to jemalloc, so that memory the application has freed is actually returned to the OS and the container's working set is not inflated indefinitely by glibc's retained heap

**Summary**: Under GROWI's load profile, glibc malloc retains hundreds of MiB of freed memory in its main arena — fragmentation prevents the sbrk heap from being trimmed, so the working set stays inflated indefinitely (this is the native-side RSS retention left open by the memory-leak investigation, not a leak and not arena proliferation). An A/B measurement on the production dist showed ~+468 MiB retention on glibc versus ~+142 MiB with jemalloc (−70%); `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2` had no effect. Because the DHI runtime has no package manager, an independent `jemalloc` build stage (`debian:13-slim`, matching the release image's distro so the library is built against the same glibc generation) provides `libjemalloc.so.2`, and the release stage copies that single `.so` to a fixed path. The entrypoint enables it **only when `JEMALLOC_ENABLED=true`**, via `LD_PRELOAD` on the **app process only** (the short-lived migration child keeps glibc). Default remains glibc — deliberately opt-in so GROWI.cloud can soak it per-app (CPU/latency) before any default flip. A missing library logs an error and boots normally on glibc; an operator-supplied `LD_PRELOAD` is preserved (jemalloc is prepended).
